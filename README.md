I build production-minded systems — not demo apps.

Currently building:
- LancerScape (Blockchain escrow marketplace)
- AI Debugging Assistant (VS Code extension)


## LancerScape

Blockchain escrow marketplace for freelancers.

- Core idea: Trustless, milestone-based payments

- Why: Platform-controlled escrow requires blind trust

- Approach: Smart contracts + minimal backend

- Tech: Solidity · Next.js · REST

- Status: Active

<details> <summary>Design decisions</summary>

- Milestone escrow to limit dispute impact

- Factory pattern for scalable contract creation

- Slower finality accepted for transparency

</details>


## AI Debugging Assistant

VS Code extension focused on diagnostics, not code generation.

- Core idea: Expose blind spots in AI-assisted code

- Why: AI tools optimize syntax, not structure

- Approach: Analyze existing code, flag risks

- Tech: TypeScript · VS Code API · AI

- Status: MVP

<details> <summary>Design decisions</summary>

- Avoided full code generation to reduce hallucinations

- Prioritized explanations over raw output

</details>





### How I Approach a Problem?
-- I usually erase everything and start from scratch. but i can't just do that everywhere. So, I'm still trying figure things out. lol
